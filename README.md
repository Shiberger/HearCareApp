# [HearCare Application](https://github.com/Shiberger/HearCareApp)
`🏦 This application was developed as a thesis project for the National Research Competition of Thailand 2025`
The project was developed in collaboration with doctors at HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center to ensure real-world clinical applicability. It was successfully submitted to the National Research Competition in Thailand, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for hearing health monitoring in both clinical and home settings.
This application bridges the gap between professional hearing healthcare and personal health monitoring, making audiometric testing more accessible while maintaining clinical standards.

# Key Features
- Clinical Hearing Tests: Implements pure tone audiometry testing following the Hughson-Westlake protocol, the gold standard for hearing assessments
- Interactive Audiograms: Visualizes test results in professional-grade audiograms using Swift Charts
- Personalized Analysis: Uses a CoreML model to classify hearing health and provide tailored recommendations
- History Tracking: Monitors hearing changes over time with detailed historical data
- Secure User Management: Integrates Firebase authentication and Firestore for secure data handling
